# Amerre

## Description 

"Welcome to Amerre" is an abstract narration based platforming game in development.
This version features the first of four planned chapters.
The game requires at least a GPU with OpenGL 3.2 support to run.

## Controls

### Keyboard

Move Left: Left arrow or A
Move Right: Left arrow or D
Jump: Space

### Controller

The game has partial controller support.
Currently only Xbox controllers are supported.
Other controllers should work but are untested because I don't own them.

The controller support in the actual gameplay is complete,
but you might have to use a mouse for the menus.

Move Left: Left stick
Move Right: Right stick
Jump: A
